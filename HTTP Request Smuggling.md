**HTTP Request Smuggling** or **HTTP Desync Attacks** occur when there’s a mismatch in how frontend and backend servers handle HTTP requests. This can lead to confusion about where one request ends and another begins. In modern applications, especially those using microservices, it can be challenging to ensure that all components process requests in the same way. If they don’t, it creates vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
