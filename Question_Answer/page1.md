**Q1. load balancer or reverse proxy  explain**

**load balancer** Primarily distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource use and enhance availability.
                  Redundancy: If one server fails, the load balancer reroutes traffic, ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime.

**Reverse Proxy** Purpose: Acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers, managing and directing requests.
                  Anonymity: Hides the identities and details of backend servers from clients, reducing exposure to attacks.
                  reverse proxies are often more focused on application-level security.
                  Improved Performance: If a user requests their profile frequently, the reverse proxy can cache responses, reducing the load on Service B.
