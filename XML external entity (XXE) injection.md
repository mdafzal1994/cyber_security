**What is XML external entity injection?**

XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. 
It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access.

**How do XXE vulnerabilities arise?**

XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerabilities occur when an application processes XML data using standard XML parsers that support potentially dangerous features. One such feature is external entities,
which allow XML to reference files or URLs outside of the document. If not properly configured, these external entities can be used by attackers to access sensitive files or perform malicious actions.


**What are the types of XXE attacks?**

There are various types of XXE attacks:

**Exploiting XXE to retrieve files**, where an external entity is defined containing the contents of a file, and returned in the application's response.

**Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks**, where an external entity is defined based on a URL to a back-end system.

**Exploiting blind XXE exfiltrate data out-of-band**, where sensitive data is transmitted from the application server to a system that the attacker controls.

**Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages**, where the attacker can trigger a parsing error message containing sensitive data.


**What is XInclude?**
XInclude is a part of the XML specification that allows an XML document to be built from sub-documents. You can place an XInclude attack within any data value in an XML document, so the attack can be performed in situations where you only control a single item of data that is placed into a server-side XML document.

XInclude is a feature in XML that allows you to include parts of other XML documents into a main XML document. It’s commonly used to break large XML documents into smaller, reusable components.
However, this feature can be exploited in security attacks, especially when the application fails to properly handle user input.

**How XInclude Attacks Work:**

In an XInclude attack, the attacker cannot control the entire XML document (like in a classic XXE attack), but they can still manipulate a small part of the XML, such as a data value within the document.
XInclude allows the attacker to inject malicious content or access files by referencing external XML files.

**Example of XInclude Attack**:
Let’s assume an application accepts user input and inserts it into a backend XML document, like a SOAP request. Normally, an attacker can’t modify the entire XML structure (because they don’t control the DOCTYPE element), but they can manipulate a part of the XML to use XInclude.

Normal XML document structure (without XInclude):
```xml
Copy code
<request>
    <user>
        <name>John Doe</name>
        <email>john@example.com</email>
    </user>
</request>
```

Now, imagine an attacker controls the name or email field and can insert arbitrary XML data into it. With XInclude, they can inject an external XML file into the document.

XML document with XInclude attack:

```xml
Copy code
<request>
    <user>
        <name xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
            <xi:include href="file:///etc/passwd"/>
        </name>
        <email>john@example.com</email>
    </user>
</request>
```





In this case, the attacker’s malicious name field now contains an XInclude element (<xi:include href="file:///etc/passwd"/>), which tells the XML parser to include the contents of the /etc/passwd file from the server into the XML document. This can leak sensitive information, such as user details or system configurations, depending on the file included.


**How to find and test for XXE vulnerabilities**

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test file retrieval by defining an external entity that points to a known system file.
   - Test for blind XXE by using a URL-based external entity and monitoring interactions with your controlled system (e.g., using Burp Collaborator).
   - Test for vulnerable inclusion of user-supplied data in XML by performing an XInclude attack to try accessing system files.


**How to prevent XXE vulnerabilities**

1. Disable External Entity Processing
Disable the processing of external entities and DTDs (Document Type Definitions) in XML parsers.
2.Input Validation and Sanitization
Validate and sanitize XML input from users to ensure it doesn't contain malicious content or unexpected structures.
Use strict XML schema validation to enforce a known, safe structure for the XML data.
3.Disable Unnecessary XML Features
Disable features such as XInclude, Entity Expansion, and DTD processing if they are not needed in your application.


**Difference in  external entities and DTDs**



**External Entities** allow XML documents to refer to external resources, which can be exploited for unauthorized file access or malicious activity.
```
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<note>
  <to>John</to>
  <from>Jane</from>
  <message>&xxe;</message>
</note>
```

**DTDs define the structure of XML documents**, ensuring the data follows a certain format, but can introduce security risks if they allow external resources (leading to XXE vulnerabilities) or are overly complex (leading to DoS risks).

```
<!DOCTYPE note [
  <!ELEMENT note (to, from, message)>
  <!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT message (#PCDATA)>
]>
<note>
  <to>John</to>
  <from>Jane</from>
  <message>Hello!</message>
</note>

```
