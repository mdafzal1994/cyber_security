**What is OAuth 2.0?**

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables users to safely share their data between different 
applications.

OAuth 2.0 enables the resource owner (i.e., the user) to give the client (i.e., the third-party application) access
to their data without having to share their credentials. Instead, the credentials are shared with the authorization
server, which issues an access token to the client. The client can then use this access token to get the user’s
data from the resource server.

**How does OAuth 2.0 work?**

Before you can understand how OAuth 2.0 works, you must first understand the four specific roles that are involved 
in the OAuth 2.0 workflow. 

Those roles are:

**Resource owner**: This is the user that is granting third-party access to their data.

**Client**: This is the third-party application that is requesting access to the resource owner’s data. 
When the resource owner grants access, the client gets an access token that can be used to request the resources
within the granted scope.

**Authorization server**: The authorization server acts as an intermediary between the client, resource owner, 
and resource server by issuing access tokens to the client after the resource owner successfully authorizes the 
request.

**Resource server**: This is the server that hosts the protected resources. It is responsible for accepting and 
responding to requests to access protected resources using an access token.

OAuth 2.0 enables the resource owner (i.e., the user) to give the client (i.e., the third-party application) access
to their data without having to share their credentials. Instead, the credentials are shared with the authorization
server, which issues an access token to the client. The client can then use this access token to get the user’s
data from the resource server.


Let’s explore how this works with our example from the previous section. In an OAuth context, the new meal planning
application is the client; it wants access to the user’s data from the fitness application. The fitness application
has both a resource server and an authorization server that authorizes access to the resource server.

Since the meal planning application is the client, it will present the user with the option to import their fitness
history data from the fitness application. If the user decides to proceed, they will be redirected to the fitness application, where they will be prompted to enter their username and password. If the user successfully logs in to the fitness application, they will see a screen where they can review the data that the client would like to access. If the user consents to the requested scope, they will authorize the request. The user will then be redirected back to the meal planning application, where their fitness history from the fitness application will now be visible.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of everything that happens under the hood:

1. The client (the meal planning app) asks the user for access to their resources on the resource server of the fitness app.
2. The user grants access to the client through the authorization server by logging in to the fitness app with their credentials. These credentials are not shared with the client. Instead, an authorization code is generated and shared with the client.
3. The client uses this authorization code to request an access token from an endpoint that is provided by the authorization server.
4. The authorization server generates and returns an access token, which the client can use to access the user’s resources on the resource server.
5. The client sends the access token to the resource server to request access to the user’s resources.
6. The resource server validates the access token with the authorization server. If the token is valid, it grants the client access to the user’s resources.

**What is the difference between access tokens and refresh tokens in OAuth?**

Access tokens are often short-lived and therefore need to be re-generated upon expiration. Refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens and often have a longer lifespan than access tokens. However, not all OAuth providers issue refresh tokens.

**What are some best practices for working with OAuth 2.0?**

When implementing OAuth 2.0, it’s essential to adhere to the following best practices in order to secure your application and protect user data:


**Use short-lived access tokens**: Limiting the lifespan of access tokens helps contain the damage if they are compromised. Refresh tokens allow legitimate clients to obtain new access tokens without involving the user.
Limit token scope: Access tokens should always have the smallest scope required for the specific application functionality.

**Secure the application against common attack patterns**: It is important to take adequate measures to reduce your system’s vulnerability to attack. For instance, using the **`state`** parameter when initiating an authorization request—and validating the returned state against the initial value—can help protect against **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks**. You should also implement rate limiting, which will help prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

**Handle access tokens securely**: Access tokens should be sent in a request header when the client is requesting a resource from the resource server. They shouldn’t be stored as cookies or transmitted over query parameters. Additionally, the authorization server must include the HTTP “Cache-Control” response header field with a value of “no-store” in any response containing tokens, credentials, or other sensitive information, as well as the “Pragma” response header field with a value of “no-cache”.

**Allow users to revoke access to their data**: OAuth 2.0 is designed in such a way that the resource owner has complete control of their data. It is therefore important to provide a mechanism to revoke tokens so that users can block unwanted access.
