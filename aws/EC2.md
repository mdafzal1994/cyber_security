# AWS EC2 Security Best Practices

Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the key points for securing your AWS environment:

1. **Use IAM Roles for EC2 Access:**
   - Assign IAM roles to EC2 instances to grant permissions securely without embedding credentials in code.

2. **Configure Security Groups:**
   - Set up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, allowing only necessary connections.

3. **Use Key Pairs for Encryption:**
   - Utilize key pairs to encrypt SSH traffic to EC2 instances, ensuring only authorized users can access them.

4. **Encrypt Data at Rest with EBS:**
   - Enable Amazon EBS encryption to protect data stored on EBS volumes, keeping it secure even if storage is compromised.

5. **Encrypt Data in Transit with S3:**
   - Use Amazon S3 encryption to secure data during transit between EC2 instances and S3, protecting it as it moves.

6. **Monitor with CloudWatch:**
   - Leverage Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and set alarms for unusual activity on your EC2 instances and other AWS resources.

7. **Log Activity with CloudTrail:**
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to log and review all changes and actions taken on your AWS resources.

8. **Assess Security with Amazon Inspector:**
   - Use Amazon Inspector to evaluate EC2 instances for vulnerabilities and compliance with security best practices.

9. **Track Changes with AWS Config:**
   - Employ AWS Config to monitor and record changes to your AWS resources, providing visibility into modifications.

10. **Check for Security Issues with Trusted Advisor:**
    - Use AWS Trusted Advisor to identify potential security issues and areas needing improvement in your AWS environment.
