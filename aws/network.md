# difference in VPC and VPN?

Amazon VPC allows you to create a logically isolated network within the AWS cloud. It provides control over network configuration, 
including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.

2. Key Features:

**Isolated Network:** Create a private, isolated network environment in the AWS cloud.

**Subnets:** Divide your VPC into subnets (public and private) to control traffic flow and organization.

**Security Groups and Network ACLs:** Implement security measures at the instance level (Security Groups) and subnet level (Network ACLs).

**Route Tables:** Define how traffic is routed within your VPC and to/from the internet.

**Internet Gateway (IGW)**: Allows instances in public subnets to access the internet.

**NAT Gateway/Instance**: Allows instances in private subnets to access the internet while keeping them isolated from inbound traffic.

**VPC Peering:** Connects multiple VPCs within the same region.

**VPC Endpoints:** Allows private connections to AWS services without using public IPs.



**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
1. Purpose: A VPN provides a secure, encrypted connection over a public network (such as the internet) to connect remote users
  or networks to a private network. It is commonly used to extend network access securely.

**AWS Network Firewall** and **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** serve distinct purposes and operate at different layers of the OSI model. Here's a detailed comparison to help understand their roles and use cases:


### Key Differences

1. **Layer of Protection:**
   - **AWS Network Firewall:** Operates at Layer 3 and Layer 4, dealing with IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
   - **AWS WAF:** Operates at Layer 7, focusing on HTTP and HTTPS traffic and application-specific threats.
   - AWS Network Firewall is stateful, meaning it tracks the state of active connections and applies rules based on this state.

2. **Traffic Filtering:**
   - **AWS Network Firewall:** Filters traffic at the network level (e.g., IP and port-based rules).
   - **AWS WAF:** Filters HTTP/HTTPS requests based on web-specific attributes (e.g., URL patterns, query strings, headers).

3. **Scope of Protection:**
   - **AWS Network Firewall:** Protects entire VPCs by filtering traffic between subnets and external networks.
   - **AWS WAF:** Protects specific web applications and APIs from web-based threats.

4. **Integration Points:**
   - **AWS Network Firewall:** Primarily integrates with VPCs and can be used to control traffic flows within and across VPCs.
   - **AWS WAF:** Integrates with CloudFront, ALB, and API Gateway to protect web applications and APIs from malicious requests.
